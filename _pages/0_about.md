Hello there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° 

Iâ€™m Johannes, an Industrial PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/) (DTU), collaborating with [JP/Politikens Media Group](https://jppol.dk/en/) on the [Platform Intelligence in News Project](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/cbs-research-projects/research-projects-overview/e3092958-c64c-46f8-94db-36c92bd0b5ed) and a visiting research scholar at the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) (UCSD). 
My work focuses on building responsible recommender systems that align with editorial values by integrating machine learning (ML) and normative design. As part of this effort, I developed and deployed the first large-scale recommender systems for [EkstraBladet.dk](https://ekstrabladet.dk/), which now serve millions of users every day.

My work bridges academic research with real-world applications, focusing on running A/B tests, implementing MLOps, and deploying production-level code and systems. Iâ€™m fortunate to work under the supervision of 
[Kasper Lindskow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasper-lindskow-6bb2089/?originalSubdomain=dk), 
[Michael R. Andersen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=cOrfSmIAAAAJ&hl=en),
[Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org/), 
and 
[Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).
