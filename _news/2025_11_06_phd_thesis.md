I’m proud to share that I have defended my Ph.D. thesis at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/)!  

After more than ten years at DTU — through my bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral studies — this milestone feels like both an ending and a new beginning in my journey in artificial intelligence and data-driven innovation. 

I am deeply grateful to my supervisors — Dr. [Kasper Lindskow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasper-lindskow-6bb2089/?originalSubdomain=dk), Assoc. Prof. [Michael R. Andersen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=cOrfSmIAAAAJ&hl=en), Assoc. Prof. [Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org/), Prof. [Lars Kai Hansen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=gQVuJh8AAAAJ&hl=da), and Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) — for their invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement throughout my Ph.D. journey. I would also like to thank the Ph.D. committee — Prof. [Christoph Trattner](https://www.christophtrattner.info/), Assoc. Prof. [Finn Årup Nielsen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=9cagBQYAAAAJ&hl=da), and Dr. [Morten Arngren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arngren/?originalSubdomain=dk&skipRedirect=true&originalSubdomain=dk) — for their thoughtful evaluation, constructive feedback, and engaging discussion during my defense.
