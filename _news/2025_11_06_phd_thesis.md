I’m proud to share that I recently defended my PhD in Computer Science at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/)!  

After more than ten years at DTU — through my bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral studies — this milestone feels like both an ending and a new beginning in my journey in artificial intelligence and data-driven innovation. Huge thanks to my supervisors 

I am deeply grateful to my supervisors — Dr. [Kasper Lindskow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasper-lindskow-6bb2089/?originalSubdomain=dk), Assoc. Prof. [Michael R. Andersen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=cOrfSmIAAAAJ&hl=en), and Assoc. Prof. [Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org/) — for their invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement throughout my PhD journey. I would also like to thank the PhD committee — Prof. [Christoph Trattner](https://www.christophtrattner.info/), Assoc. Prof. [Finn Årup Nielsen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=9cagBQYAAAAJ&hl=da), and Dr. [Morten Arngren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arngren/?originalSubdomain=dk&skipRedirect=true&originalSubdomain=dk) — for their thoughtful evaluation, constructive feedback, and engaging discussion during my defense.
