The Platform Intelligence in News project (PIN), for which I have worked as an industrial PhD since 2021, has just published a report with recommendations on AI for news publishers! ü§ñ

If this interests you, the report can be downloaded here: [Insights and Recommendations for News Publishers](https://jppol.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pin-industrialreport-2024-final-6.pdf).

One of the report's main recommendations is that news media should invest in developing artificial intelligence tailored to the specific needs of the news domain and aligned with their editorial missions and strategies. 

The report also presents 15 concrete insights and 15 recommendations covering technology, journalism, business, and user considerations related to the development and use of AI in the media.
